1.Define a class Date. Overload the operator '+' such that it adds
 a given date with certain number of days.

2. Distance is measured in feet and inches unit. Use operator
 overloading for  '+' operator for adding two such distances and '<' for
 comparing two such distances. (one of the operator function should be
 implemented as friend function.)

3. Write a program using operator overloading to overload Stream 
operators (<< and >>) to read and display the objects of complex class.
 
4. A class representing distance is measured in the unit of feet and inches.
 Write a program to do conversion from meter unit to objects of class
 type and objects of class type to meter.

5. Polar coordinates are represented in angle and radius format
 while rectangular coordinates represented as (x,y).
 Define classes for both types and include member functions to convert
 from polar to rectangular coordinates.(conversion from class to class.)

6. Employee class contain details like name,emp no,pay rate,
 constructor function and a pay() function. Manager class inherits
 from employee and has the option of drawing pay on hourly basis or
 salary basis and has an additional data issalaried(bool).
 Class Supervisor is derived from employee  and has an additional
 field department and is always salaried. Base and both  derived
 classes should contain pay() function with same name.


7. Write a C++ program to create a class STUDENT with age name and
 register number. Using Inheritance, derive two classes MTech-stud
 and BTech-stud.List both the category of students in the increasing order
 of marks( for BTech-stud) and gpa( for MTech-stud). In case of tie,
 display whichever name comes first. Make sort() function as a virtual function.


8. Implement the base class Shape and derive triangle,rectangle,
 circle and square classes from it. Implement functions to compute
 the area and perimeter of the polygon. Use the concept of pure
 virtual functions.
