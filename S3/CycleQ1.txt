 * Phone no interchange:
 - A phone number, such as (212) 767-8900, can be thought of as having three
    parts: the area code (212), the exchange (767), and the number (8900).
    Write a C++ program that uses a structure to store these three parts of a
    phone number separately. Call the structure phone. Create two structure
    variables of type phone. Initialize one, and have the user input a number
    for the other one. Then display both numbers. The interchange might look
    like this:
	Enter your area code, exchange, and number: 415 555 1212
	My number is (212) 767-8900
	Your number is (415) 555-1212

 * Date validator:
 - Define a class Date that contains details like year, month and date. Write a
    C++ program to check the validity of the date that you enter and display
    the next date.
	Sample 1 : 02/ 03/ 1990
	Valid, Next date: 03/03/1990
	Sample 2: 29/02/1989
	Not Valid

 * Bank account:
 - Define a class to represent bank account. Include members like name of
    depositor, account no, Type of account, balance amount in the account.
    Write C++ program with member functions to a) Assign initial values b)
    To deposit an account c) To withdraw an amount after checking the balance
    d) To display name and balance

 * Triangle validator:
 - Write a class which represents the shape triangle. The member functions
    should a) Check the validity of the triangle b) display the sides c) find the
    area and display it.
