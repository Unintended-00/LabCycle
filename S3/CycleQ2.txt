 - Write class which contains an integer array and a static function to find
    the average of that array. Create THREE objects. Read the values into the
    array using one object, and find the average. Let the second object
    modifies the value by multiplying each element by a certain multiplier.
    Repeat the process of finding the average usng first object.


 - Write a program to find shortest distance between three coordinates points,
   representing vertices of a triangle, using inline function.


 - Write a function called swap() that interchanges two int values belonging
    to an object, passed as parameter to it by the calling program. Write a C++
    program to demonstrate call by value, call by reference and call by
    address.

 - Write a function called power() that takes a double value for n and an int
    value for p, and returns the result as a double value. Create a series of
    overloaded functions with the same name that, in addition to double, also
    work with types char, int, long, and float. Write a main() program that
    exercises these overloaded functions with all argument types.
